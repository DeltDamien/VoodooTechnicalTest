# Personalized Offer System for a Mobile Game SDK

## Introduction
This project aims to design a personalized offer system for a mobile game SDK. The system allows server-side configuration of offers, including rewards, prices, triggers, validation conditions, and user segmentation. The system must also be extensible to support additional features such as multiple offers, chained offers, and endless offers.

### Problem Statement
The main challenge is to create a scalable and modular system that clearly separates responsibilities between the client (Unity) and the server. The system must handle dynamic offers, validate complex conditions, and adapt to new types of offers and triggers with minimal changes.
